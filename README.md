# 🎮 BG13 — Hall 13 Battle Game

**BG13** is a competitive two–player slingshot battle game inspired by the **2024 Hall 13 Diwali B-Block + D-Block vs C-Block + E-Block rivalry** — a night that was nothing short of an actual battleground.

The chaos, the windows, the fireworks, the shouting —
This game **captures the spirit of that legendary night.**

## 🔥 Origin Story — Why "BG13"?

During Diwali in **Hall 13**, hostels **B + D Blocks** and **C + E Blocks** turned the corridor windows into **strategic artillery stations**.  
Paper bullets, rockets, crackers, bottles — everything became **weapons**.

The battlefield?  
The sky between buildings.

This game is a tribute to that iconic night — recreated safely as a **fun strategy game**, not an actual war 😄  
Hence:
