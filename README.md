## 🔥 Origin Story — Why "BG13"?

During **Diwali in Hall 13**, hostels **B + D Blocks** and **C + E Blocks** entered into a playful but intense rivalry.  
Students lined up at their windows, launching *anything they could turn into a projectile*.  
The sky between buildings became a **war zone** of aim, and excitement.

This game is a **fun, safe, digital tribute** to that unforgettable **Diwali War**.
